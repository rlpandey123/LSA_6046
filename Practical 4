Aim: Configure NFS Server to share directories on your Network, Configure NFS Client
Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server
Before installing the NFS Kernel server, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:
$ sudo apt-get update
To install the NFS Kernel Server on your system:
$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Step 2: Create the Export Directory
The directory that we want to share with the client system is called an export directory. WE can name it according to our choice; here, we are creating an export directory by the name of “sharedfolder” in our system’s mnt(mount) directory.
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder
As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive permissions of the export folder through the following commands:
$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/sharedfolder
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/sharedfolder
Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file
After creating the export folder, we will need to provide the clients the permission to access the host server machine. This permission is defined through the exports file located in your system’s /etc folder. 
$ sudo nano /etc/exports
Editing this file needs root access; therefore you will need to use sudo with your command.
A single client by adding the following line in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/sharedfolder subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check
The permissions “rw,sync,no_subtree_check” permissions defined in this file mean that the client(s) can perform:
rw: read and write operations
sync: write any change to the disc before applying it
no_subtree_check: prevent subtree checking
Step 4: Export the shared directory
$ sudo exportfs -a
Finally, in order to make all the configurations take effect, restart the NFS Kernel server as follows:
$ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s)
An important step is to verify that the server’s firewall is open to the clients so that they can access the shared content.
$ sudo ufw allow from [clientIP or clientSubnetIP] to any port nfs
$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.100/24 to any port nfs
$ sudo ufw status

Configuring the Client Machine
Step 1: Install NFS Common
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
The system will prompt you with a Y/n option to confirm if you want to continue with the installation. Please enter Y and then hit Enter to continue, after which the software will be successfully installed on your system.
Step 2: Create a mount point for the NFS host’s shared folder
Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create this folder anywhere on your system. We are creating a mount folder in the mnt directory of our client’s machine:
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder_client
Step 3: Mount the shared directory on the client
Mount the shared folder from the host to a mount folder on the client:
$ sudo mount serverIP:/exportFolder_server /mnt/mountfolder_client
$ sudo mount 192.168.100.5:/mnt/sharedfolder /mnt/sharedfolder_client
Step 4: Test the connection
